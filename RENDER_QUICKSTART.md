## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First Load (Cold Start)
- **First visit:** Takes 20-30 seconds (container wakes up)
- **After that:** Instant loading
- **Auto-sleeps:** After 15 min of no activity
- **Auto-wakes:** When someone visits

**Tell viewers:** "First load might take 30 seconds, then it's fast!"

### Data Persistence
- ✅ All predictions saved in `predictions.json`
- ✅ Survives restarts/sleeps
- ✅ Persists for 20 days (and beyond)
- ⚠️ Only resets if you redeploy code

### Free Tier Limits
- **750 hours/month** = 31 days continuous
- **100 GB bandwidth** = ~10,000 visitors
- **More than enough** for your experiment!
