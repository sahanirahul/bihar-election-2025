# Render Free Tier: 512 MB RAM - Is It Enough?

## TL;DR: **YES! More Than Enough** ✅

For your use case (~100 users, 20 days), 512 MB is **plenty**.

## Memory Breakdown

### Your App's Memory Usage:

| Component | Memory Used |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Node.js Alpine Base** | ~50 MB |
| **Node.js Runtime** | ~50-80 MB |
| **Express + Dependencies** | ~20-30 MB |
| **Your App Code** | < 1 MB |
| **predictions.json** | < 1 KB (even with 500 predictions) |
| **Active Connections** | ~5-10 MB (100 concurrent users) |
| **Total** | **~150-200 MB** |

**Available:** 512 MB  
**Your Usage:** ~200 MB  
**Buffer:** ~300 MB (plenty of room!)

---

## Real World Performance

### Expected Scenarios:

**Light Traffic (Most Likely):**
```
Users: 10-50
Predictions: 20-50
Memory: ~120-150 MB
Status: ✅ Excellent
```

**Moderate Traffic:**
```
Users: 100-200 concurrent
Predictions: 100-200
Memory: ~180-220 MB
Status: ✅ Great
```

**Heavy Traffic (Unlikely for 20 days):**
```
Users: 500+ concurrent
Predictions: 500+
Memory: ~250-300 MB
Status: ✅ Still fine!
```

**You'd need to worry only if:**
- 1000+ concurrent users (very unlikely!)
- Memory leaks (shouldn't happen with this code)

---

## Why Your App is Lightweight

✅ **Node.js Alpine** - Minimal Linux distro (~5 MB vs 100+ MB regular)  
✅ **JSON File** - No database overhead  
✅ **Simple Express** - No heavy frameworks  
✅ **Static Frontend** - Served as files, not rendered  
✅ **No Image Processing** - Just serving JPG files  

---

## Monitoring on Render

Once deployed, check memory usage:

1. **Render Dashboard** → Your Service
2. Click **"Metrics"** tab
3. See real-time memory usage

**What to expect:**
- Idle: ~100-120 MB
- Active: ~150-200 MB
- Peak: ~200-250 MB

## Comparison with Other Free Tiers

| Platform | Free Tier RAM | Your App Needs | Verdict |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Render** | 512 MB | ~200 MB | ✅ Perfect |
| Heroku Free | 512 MB | ~200 MB | ✅ Same |
| Railway | 512 MB | ~200 MB | ✅ Same |
| Fly.io | 256 MB | ~200 MB | ⚠️ Tight |
| Vercel | 1024 MB | ~200 MB | ✅ Overkill |

---

## What If You Run Out? (Very Unlikely)

**Signs:**
- App becomes slow
- Random crashes
- "Out of Memory" errors in logs

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month for 1 GB)
2. Add rate limiting (already have it!)
3. Clean old predictions (not needed for 20 days)

**For your 20-day experiment: You won't need any of these!**

---

## JSON File vs Database

**Why JSON is perfect for 512 MB:**

### JSON File Storage:
```
100 predictions = ~10 KB
500 predictions = ~50 KB
1000 predictions = ~100 KB
```

### If you used PostgreSQL:
```
PostgreSQL process = ~50-100 MB extra
Database overhead = ~20-30 MB
Total extra = ~70-130 MB
```

**You saved ~100 MB by using JSON!** 🎉

---

## Conclusion

### For Your Use Case:

- **Duration:** 20 days
- **Expected Users:** 10-100
- **Expected Predictions:** 50-200
- **512 MB RAM:** **More than sufficient**

**You have 2-3x more RAM than you'll need!**

---

## Want to Verify Locally?

Check memory usage while running:

```bash
# Start your app
docker stats

# Or without Docker
node backend/server-combined.js &
ps aux | grep node
```

You'll see it uses ~100-200 MB even under load.

---

## Summary

✅ **512 MB is MORE than enough**  
✅ **Your app uses ~200 MB**  
✅ **300+ MB buffer for spikes**  
✅ **No worries for 20 days**  
✅ **Even 100+ users will be fine**

**Don't worry about RAM - you're good!** 🚀
